# Who am I? ðŸ¤”

Hello everyone! 

My name is Cristina - an enthusiastic, determined and proactive **Full Stack Developer** looking for a _Junior Software Developer_ position. 

Previously, I was Head of Production for a couple of the most prestigious bakeries and cake companies across London, leading mid-sized teams and managing the supply-chain system to deliver products according to increasing demand in quantities and quality. Whilst structuring processes, I was able to further develop my problem-solving skills and adapt to the constant changes in the sector.  

A couple of months ago, I decided to change my career and enroll Makers to become a Software Dev, as I discovered my passion for coding while building a simple app in Swift. That is when I realised what really excites me about tech - the possibility to provide _useful software_ to alleviate burden in any form. Read: improve quality of professional and personal life in a general manner.

## ðŸ¤¹ Soft Skills 

#### Team Work and Communication Skills

â€¢ _Leading_ teams in most of my jobs, _delegating_ tasks according to skills and giving the team the opportunity to grow professionally<br>
â€¢ Giving and receiving feedback, acting as a _collaborator_ rather than someone at a higher hierarchical level 

#### Adaptability

â€¢ Having moved to different countries because of my previous job positions, I was able to _adapt quickly_ to new cultures and professional environment<br>
â€¢ My _growth mindset_ and _progressive learning_ attitude helped me adjust and become more resilient to challenges

#### Problem-solving with time management 

â€¢ What to do when I face a _big challenge_ in my life or work? I tend to _map the triggers_ of the challenge and analyse each single aspect that will make that challenge not be a challenge anymore.<br>
â€¢ I.e.: while planning a Royal Wedding for 1000 guests (held in Qatar), I managed a team of 4 people to prepare and pack 1 tonne of goods to be flewn to Qatar in 3 weeks, and having 5 remaining days in loco to finish the products. My _thinking process_ would be going backwards, seeing what I needed to deliver in which time frame, and _structuring_ the production and _sprints_ accordingly.

#### Language fluency

â€¢ I speak fluently English, Portuguese, Spanish and German. French and Japanese need to be refreshed, but I used to be fluent as well!
