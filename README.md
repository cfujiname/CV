# Who am I?

Hello everyone! 

My name is Cristina and I am a Full Stack Developer looking for a Software Dev position. 

Previously, I was the Head of Production for a couple of the most prestigious bakeries and cake companies across London, leading mid-sized teams and managing the supply-chain system to deliver products according to increasing demand in quantities and quality - including Royal Weddings in the Middle East.

A couple of months ago, I decided to change my career and enroll Makers to become a Software Dev, as I discovered my passion for coding while building a simple app in Swift. That is when I realised what really excites me about tech - the possibility to provide useful software to alleviate burden in any form. _Read: improve quality of professional and personal life in a general manner._
