# Who am I?

Hello everyone! 

My name is Cristina and I am a Full Stack Developer looking for a Software Dev position. 

Previously, I was the Head of Production for a couple of the most prestigious bakeries and cake companies across London, leading mid-sized teams and managing the supply-chain system to deliver products according to increasing demand in quantities and quality - including Royal Weddings in the Middle East.

A couple of months ago, I decided to change my career and enroll Makers to become a Software Dev, as I discovered my passion for coding while building a simple app in Swift. That is when I realised what really excites me about tech - the possibility to provide useful software to alleviate burden in any form. _Read: improve quality of professional and personal life in a general manner._

# Skills


## Tech Skills (tech stack, testing libraries, frontend, backend)
## Soft Skills 

#### Team Work and Communication Skills

- Leading teams in most of my jobs, delegating tasks according to skills and giving the team the opportunity to grow professionally
- Giving and receiving feedback, acting as a collaborator rather than someone at a higher hierarchical level 

#### Adaptability

- Having moved to different countries because of my previous job positions, I was able to adapt quickly to new cultures and professional environment
- My growth mindset and progressive learning attitude helped me adjust and become more resilient to challenges

#### Problem-solving

- What to do when I face a big challenge in my life or work? I tend to map the triggers of the challenge and analyse each single aspect that will make that challenge not be a challenge anymore.
- I.e.: while planning a Royal Wedding for 1000 guests (held in Qatar), I managed a team of 4 people to prepare and pack 1 tonne of goods to be flewn to Qatar in 3 weeks, and having 5 remaining days in loco to finish the products. My thinking process would be backwards, seeing what I needed to deliver in which time frame, and structuring the production accordingly

#### Language fluency

- I speak fluently English, Portuguese, Spanish and German. French and Japanese need to be refreshed, but I used to be fluent as well!
